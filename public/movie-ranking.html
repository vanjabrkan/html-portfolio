<h1>The Best Movies According to Vanja</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie. The trilogy follows the journey of Frodo Baggins, a young hobbit from the Shire, who inherits a powerful but dangerous ring from his uncle, Bilbo Baggins. This ring, forged by the dark lord Sauron, holds immense power and threatens to corrupt and control all of Middle-earth if it falls into the wrong hands. With the help of a diverse fellowship consisting of hobbits, elves, dwarves, men, and wizards, Frodo sets out on a perilous quest to destroy the ring in the fires of Mount Doom, where it was forged.</p>

<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>The story begins with "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"), where we meet Harry Potter, an orphaned boy who discovers he is a wizard on his eleventh birthday. He receives an acceptance letter to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and begins his journey into the magical world.</p>

<h3>Room</h3>
<p>The story revolves around Jack, a bright and curious five-year-old boy, and his loving mother Ma, who are held captive in a small room. The room is the only world Jack has ever known, and he believes it to be the entirety of the universe. Ma, however, has created a nurturing environment for Jack despite their harrowing circumstances, shielding him from the grim reality of their captivity as much as possible.</p>
